        <h1> cout<<"Let's Start With C++"; </h1>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. </p>
        <p>C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.</p>
        <h3>Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:</h3>
        <P><b>Simple:</b> It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.<br>
            <b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b> A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.<br>
            <b>Mid-level language:</b> It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)<br>
            <b>Rich library support:</b> Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.<br>
            <b>Speed of execution:</b> C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.<br>
            <b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b> C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).<br>
            <b>Object-Oriented:</b> One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.<br>
            <b>Compiled Language:</b> C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</P>
