        <h1> cout<<"Let's Start With C++"; </h1>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. </p>
        <p>C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.</p>
        <h3>Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:</h3>
        <P><b><u>Simple:</u></b> It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.<br>
            <b><u>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</u></b> A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.<br>
            <b> <u> Mid-level language:</u></b> It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)<br>
            <b><u>Rich library support:</u></b> Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.<br>
            <b><u>Speed of execution:</u></b> C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.<br>
            <b><u>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</u></b> C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).<br>
            <b><u>Object-Oriented:</u></b> One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.<br>
            <b><u>Compiled Language:</u></b> C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</P>

            <h3>→ CALCULATOR USING C++</h3>
            <P>(please turn on intractive mode for executing)</P>
            <P>This is a <u>Simple Calculator</u> using do while loop and switch case statement.Here enter a choice(1,2,3,...) according to your requirement</P>

            <h3>→ BANKING SYSTEM USING C++</h3>
            <P>(please turn on intractive mode for executing)</P>
            <P>This is <u>a Banking management system</u> using do while loop and switch case statement.</P>
            <p>Talking about the features of this system, a user can create an account by providing the name of the account holder, account number, and providing an initial amount. Then the user can also deposit and withdraw money just by providing his/her account. The user can also check for the balance inquiry which displays the account holder’s name with account number and amount. The user can also view all the account holder’s list. Another feature is that the user can also close the account by providing the account number.</p>

            <h3>→ LOGIN AND REGESTRATION SYSTEM USING C++</h3>
            <P>(please turn on intractive mode for executing)</P>
            <P>This is a<u>  Login And Regestration System </u> using loops and file stream. First regester a user by choosing 2 then you can login with that or if you forget the pass or username you can retrive it by choosing 3. </P>
            <P><u>Logic  Explanation</u><br>
                • First we will give two options for user 1st one is are you want to register or want to login.<br> 
                • Then if he wants to register then we ask to enter the username and password and we store this into a file .<br>
                • Then if the user want to login , we ask to user please enter the username and password then we will check the username and password that user enter is present in our file if not we print a message that  "Invalid username and password"  ,if present then we print a message that "successfully login".<br>
                • This is the overall logic about this project see the source code you will clarify more.<br></P>
